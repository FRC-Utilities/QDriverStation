# ConsoleDS

A simple DS implementatation for command line interfaces with ncurses/pdcurses. Joystick support implemented with SDL.

### Dependencies

If you are using Linux, you will need to install the following packages:

- `sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev`
- `sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev`

If you are using Mac OSX, use [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh) to install ncurses:

- `brew install ncurses`

I have already included the static SDL library for OSX users.
This project already provides the libraries for Microsoft Windows.
